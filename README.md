# IVGD-union
"Union" themed game/prototype project

BRIEF
We have [a lot](https://tree.taiga.io/project/suprko-ivgd-prototype-assignment-3/kanban) of ideas for this game. We were hoping to do some prototyping over the weekend, but due to many Life Events (most notably MIGS) it seems unlikely that we'll have made/played/discussed enough prototypes to have settled on a single, specific idea for the game.

That said, we did identify some common threads for design/mechanics running throughout our discussions. Whatever thematic/narrative direction our game takes, we are interested in exploring:
- Multiplayer
  - Most likely 2-player co-op
- Incomplete information
  - Between players especially
  - Perhaps also between player and game
- Asymmetric gameplay
  - Different mechanics, maybe even different platforms, for different players
  
Relating to the theme of "Union", our interest is in building mechanics in which players are actually incapable of progressing without cooperation.
