# IVGD-union
"Union" themed game/prototype project

BRIEF
We have [a lot](https://tree.taiga.io/project/suprko-ivgd-prototype-assignment-3/kanban) of ideas for this game. We were hoping to do some prototyping over the weekend, but due to many Life Events (most notably MIGS) it seems unlikely that we'll have made/played/discussed enough prototypes to have settled on a single, specific idea for the game.

That said, we did identify some common threads for design/mechanics running throughout our discussions. Whatever thematic/narrative direction our game takes, we are interested in exploring:
- Multiplayer
  - Most likely 2-player co-op
- Incomplete information
  - Between players especially
  - Perhaps also between player and game
- Asymmetric gameplay
  - Different mechanics, maybe even different platforms, for different players
  
Relating to the theme of "Union", our interest is in building mechanics in which players are actually incapable of progressing without cooperation.

--Initial Concept

God is watching. (First Person View Controls)

You awaken in a dungeon-like room to the sound of a man screaming. There are two ragged men in the dilapidated room with you, and they are chained to the floor with long chains that are attached to their wrists, you are free. One of the men is screaming for his life, fighting vigorously to break the chains, the other is calm siting down in lotus position and meditating. There is a hole in the ceiling with a stair case leading up. It feels like the room is upside down.

At this point, the game prompts you to breathe. You hold down right mouse button to inhale and let go to exhale. You notice a breath meter at the top of the screen. You are not sure what will happen if it goes to zero, but it goes down if you stop breathing. The man is still screaming and trying to break the chains. At this point, the room starts filling with water and you remember that you don't know how to swim.

On the floor is a bible (or whatever object), when you pick it up, you become connected with God. God is a second player who uses a phone's gyroscope to rotate the entire level. At this point, if god flips the level upside down, you must be careful not to inhale while you are underwater or you will drown. You will also take damage if the level is flipped around too fast or if you fall onto sharp objects. Flipping the level will also cause the prisoners to flip upside down and be hanging from their chains (an potentially be drowning if the water level is already high enough.)

At this point, you can make a choice. If you take a couple of seconds, you can find a tool that will allow you to cut the chains of the prisoners. If you choose to save them, the one who was screaming will follow you. The one who is meditating will let himself drown either way. You can also choose to let them drown and save only yourself.

This first room can be beaten by having god flip the level upside down and letting the water drain down the stairs. Then you can walk down the stairs to reveal a large level with different water, dams, gates, platforms and the like.

At this point you get a prompt on the bottom of the screen that never goes away. "Hold X button to give up". You can hold the x button and your character is transported to hell, when you let go of the x button you are transferred back to the level, in the same place you were.

The goals of the game leads you through the level, where you must deal with the rising water levels with help of God who must carefully rotate the level to make sure you stay on the platforms because you can't swim. All the while, you encounter prisoners who need your help to break their chains and they will then follow you. You also will eventually NEED the help of the prisoners you save, but the game never explicitly forces you to save them.

At the end of the game, you cross a door that leads to heaven and the game shows you how many people you let die. If the number is too high, God can choose to send you to hell.
